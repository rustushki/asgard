Quick Start Instructions:
===============================================================================

We thank you for taking interest in Asgard!  As this project is still in its
infancy, this release is intended for testing, observation and interest
piquing. 

Asgard 0.3.8 is a step in the right direction.  The bare-bones map now supports
movement of a Character.  When the Character approaches the margins of the
screen, the map automatically pans.

We encourage you to attempt to compile and run Asgard.  Let us know how things
go.  Thanks.
