Quick Start Instructions:
===============================================================================

We thank you for taking interest in Asgard!  As this project is still in its
infancy, this release is intended for testing, observation and interest
piquing. 

Asgard 0.3.10 is a step in the right direction.  The bare-bones map now supports
movement of a Character.  When the Character approaches the margins of the
screen, the map automatically pans.  If a Character intersects with another
object on the map, the Character and the map object are stacked appropriately.
Sometimes the Character will 'collide' with something on the map and be unable
to proceed.  The Map is really coming together now.

We encourage you to attempt to compile and run Asgard.  Let us know how things
go.  Thanks.
