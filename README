Quick Start Instructions:

We thank you for taking interest in Asgard!  As this project is still in its
infancy, this release is intended for testing and observation.  We encourage
you to attempt to compile and run it.  Let us know how things go.

1. Get scons
Compiling is a little shakey right now.  The compilation method included with
this source is scons.  You're welcome to use it if you like.  scons can be
acquired at http://www.scons.org.

2. Install boost 1.36
Our new threading system requires some of the features in boost 1.36, so you
will need to install it as well.  Sources can be obtained from
http://www.boost.org

3. Be sure you have SDL and sqlite3 as well.

http://www.libsdl.org

4. Create the application database.
You can do this by:
% cd $PKG/database/
% make
% make create
% make install

5. Now compile the project..
% cd $PKG/src/
% scons

6. To Run:
./asgard

7. The only command it accepts right now is

      load boundingbox $x

where $x is an integer.  There are a few bounding boxes in the test
environment.  We recommend 1, 2, or 3.
