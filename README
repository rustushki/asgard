Quick Start Instructions:
===============================================================================

We thank you for taking interest in Asgard!  As this project is still in its
infancy, this release is intended for testing and observation.  

You can now observe that we have a functional graphics engine which displays a
dancing blue cat!

We encourage you to attempt to compile and run it.  Let us know how things go.

1. Get scons
Compiling is a little shakey right now.  The compilation method included with
this source is scons.  You're welcome to use it if you like.  scons can be
acquired at http://www.scons.org.

2. Install boost 1.40 or greater
2. Satisfy Requirements

Our new threading system requires some of the features in boost 1.36, so you
will need to install it as well.  Sources can be obtained from
SDL    - http://www.libsdl.org
SQLite - http://www.sqlite.org
Boost  - http://www.boost.org

4. Create the application database.
You can do this by:
% cd $PKG/database/
% make
% make create
% make install

5. Now compile the project..
% cd $PKG/src/
% scons

6. To Run: (filename argument)
% ./asgard test.py
-or- (stdin)
% ./asgard < test.py
-or- (interactive mode)
% ./asgard -i

You should see the dancing blue cat in the top left hand corner.
